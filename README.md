# C-Music-Manager-App

This project is still currently under construction.


The main purpose of this application is to allow a user to manage music data in a T-SQL database. There are 3 entities in the application: Albums, Artists, and Songs. The Artist entity has a many to many relation with the other entities. There is a page to display individual information about each entity as well as pages for displaying lists of all entities of a specific type. Validation is present in some areas but not all.

The database consists of 5 tables. 3 of which are for the entities and the other two that keep track of the relationships between the artists and the other entities. 

Technologies and lanugages used in this application include C#, .Net Winforms, Entity Framework Core, and T-SQL.
